			<p>A spectacular, two-alarm fire gutted Eugene’s beloved Civic Stadium — and the dreams that went with it — on Monday.</p>

			<p>Nearly 40 emergency personnel responded to the blaze, which was called in at 5:26 p.m. Upon arrival, firefighters found flames that were twice the height of the stadium. A huge plume of black smoke could be seen from across much of the city.</p>

		<div class="bat_story">
			<p>The cause and origin of the fire was not immediately known, but the wooden structure’s dry, seasoned lumber caused the fire to spread quickly, Eugene Springfield Fire Chief Randy Groves said at the scene.</p>

			<p>He said the stadium is a total loss.</p>

			<p>The fire was declared contained just after 7 p.m. and was no longer deemed in danger of spreading to neighboring fields or other property as initially feared.</p>

			<p>Firefighters were putting out spot fires in nearby bushes as late as 8 p.m., however, and some planned to remain at the scene throughout the night, working any hot spots.</p>

		<div class="bat_story">
			<p>Groves said there were no injuries related to the fire, but as a precaution, residents within two blocks of the stadium were ordered evacuated.</p>

			<p>The evacuation was lifted at 9 p.m., but traffic surrounding the stadium remained blocked.</p>

			<p>Fire officials advised residents whose homes are downwind or near the fire to check for smoldering embers in any bark areas, in dry vegetation around the house, or gutters and roofs.</p><p>Eugene police had to keep citizens back from powerlines earlier in the evening as firefighters continued to fight the flames. At least one transformer exploded, as hundreds of people gathered to get a closer look. At least three people were quickly turned away by officers as they tried to sneak under police tape that outlined a two-block perimeter around the stadium at 20th Avenue and Willamette Street.</p>

			<h3>“We’re really heartbroken”</h3>
			
			<p>Among those in shock at the unfolding scene were Eugene Civic Alliance leaders, who worked for years to secure the stadium from the city of Eugene and Eugene School District. The alliance had plans to convert the stadium so it could be used for soccer and other sports.</p>

		<div class="bat_story">
			<p>“We’re really heartbroken,” said Derek Johnson, the alliance’s co-founder, at the scene. “It’s a hard day.”</p>

			<p>Johnson said several people called and told him what had happened. He said he arrived about 30 minutes after the fire was reported.</p>

			<p>“When I first heard, I was desperately hoping that something could be saved of the stadium,” he said. “It’s a magnificent structure but it was wood, and that was one of the parts of it that was really beautiful. But that wood ... that’s an impermanent structure.”</p>

			<p>Kidsports Executive Director Bev Smith, also a member of the alliance, thanked firefighters for their efforts to save the structure.</p>

			<p>“All we can really say is, it’s sad,” she said at the scene.</p>

			<p>Later in the evening, the alliance issued a statement indicating that the stadium was insured for up to $3 million, and that renovation was to have begun next month.</p>

			<p>“It is too early for us to know where we go from here,” the statement said. “We ask for a bit of grace and patience as we come to grips with this loss to our community and to our effort. ... Civic is an important touchstone for our community, and today we mourn its loss.”</p>

			<p>Eugene School Board member Anne Marie Levis called the fire “profoundly sad. We worked so hard to save it for future generations.”</p>

			<h3>Crowd gasps as stadium falls</h3>
			
			<p>Hundreds of people swarmed around the east bank of Amazon Creek near South Eugene High School as the fire ripped through the stadium’s wooden beams.</p>

			<p>“When I came down here two hours ago it was just a normal day. This is horrible,” Eugene resident Alison Weibel said at about 5:50 p.m., after bringing her 11-year-old son to the Amazon Park fields for a baseball game earlier in the afternoon.</p>

			<p>“I went to games at Civic 30 years ago,” said Cynthia Dahlquist, 62, watching the stadium burn from across Amazon Creek.</p>

		<div class="bat_story">
			<p>Onlookers filled the pedestrian path that winds south from the high school. They braced themselves against the fire’s heat, even from across the creek and Amazon Parkway.</p>

			<p>The crowd gasped all at once as a burning piece of stadium crumbled and collapsed just before 6 p.m.</p>

			<p>“Civic Stadium is gone!” a man shouted in his cellphone. Dozens of others were calling friends and family, snapping photos and shooting videos.</p>

			<p>Tom Bowen recalled coming to the stadium to play baseball in elementary school in 1945.</p>

			<p>“It’s an emotional feeling,” said Bowen, later a longtime baseball coach at Sheldon High School. “All those years playing here ...”</p>

			<h3>Speculation about cause</h3>
			
			<p>Speculation about the fire’s cause was rampant.</p>

			<p>“It’s got to be arson,” Corey Delgado, 20, said from the edge of the high school.</p>

			<p>“It was probably somebody shooting fireworks,” Sylvia Guevara, 18, responded.</p>

		<div class="bat_story">
			<p>One spectator, on South Eugene High’s nearby baseball field, said he saw the fire start.</p>

			<p>“I looked over and there was a small fire, just a couple feet wide, inside the press box, about 20 to 30 feet up from home plate,” said Danny Sales, South Eugene High’s head baseball coach. He said he immediately called 911 just before 5:30 p.m.</p>
			
			<p>The dispatcher said it was the first he’d heard of it.</p>

			<p>“And by the time I got off the phone with the operator, the whole stadium was on fire,” said Sales, who made the call in the middle of the third inning of the Axemen’s game against Pleasant Hill.</p>

			<p>The game was called off, and coaches turned on the sprinkler system to protect the field. And then, “We watched an early Fourth of July fireworks show, I guess,” he said.</p>

			<p>Sales said he saw four boys on bikes riding in the stadium’s parking lot, then carrying their bikes over the pedestrian bridge that spans Amazon Parkway between the stadium and the high school, as the fire spread.</p>

			<p>“I’m not jumping to conclusions,” he said of the four boys, whom he described as being of middle school age. “But we did see them over there.”</p>

		<div class="bat_story">
			<p>A mother of one of the ballplayers said her son also said that he and others saw four young people walk across the overpass.</p>
			
			<p>Police said they are seeking the public’s help as they continue to investigate the cause of the fire. Anyone with potentially relevant information, or who took photos or videos at the scene, is asked to call the police department’s tipline at 541-682-8888.</p>

			<p>Even though slightly breezy conditions and hot temperatures helped the fire’s smoke rise, the Lane Regional Air Protection Agency’s air quality monitor at Amazon Park picked up an increase in particulate matter not long after the fire began.</p>

			<p>There continues to be a possibility of residual fire debris or fallout on neighboring properties, agency spokeswoman Jo Niehaus said in a statement. To dispose of any such debris properly, mist it with water and use gloves to place it into a sealable plastic bag, she said.</p>
